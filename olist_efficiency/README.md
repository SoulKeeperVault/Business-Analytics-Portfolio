# Olist — Operational Efficiency & Customer Retention

**Business question**: Where are delivery bottlenecks impacting customer experience and retention?

## Methods
- SQL-based extraction and joins; Excel data validation
- KPI dashboards for on-time delivery, backlog, cancellations
- Cohort analysis for churn proxy

## Result (from report)
- Routing/warehousing recommendations projected **~30% reduction in delivery time** and improved retention.

## How to run
- Execute queries in `sql/olist_queries.sql` against the public Olist dataset (or your anonymised tables).
- Open visuals in `dashboards/` or notebooks in `notebooks/`.

## Files
- `sql/` — query templates (placeholder)
- `dashboards/` — screenshots/Power BI export images
- `notebooks/` — analysis notebooks (placeholder)
- `data/` — no raw data committed

## Notes
- Do not upload proprietary order/customer data. Use Kaggle's public Olist data where appropriate.
